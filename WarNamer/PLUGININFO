Description = '''Changes Soulseek username to one randomly chosen from a user-defined list every time the plugin loads. (Every time Nicotine+ starts, or whenever the plugin is enabled in Nicotine+ preferences.)
The minimum time between changes (in seconds) is configurable in the plugin settings. For example, set to 86400 to ensure the plugin doesn't change usernames more than once per day.'''
